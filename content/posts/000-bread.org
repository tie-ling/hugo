** Q: Can I use a prepackaged bread machine mix in my Home Bakery? What course should I use?
A: At Zojirushi, we thoroughly test recipes we develop to ensure a
successful result. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the outcome of
prepackaged bread machine mixes since we have not tested them. We
suggest reaching out to the bread mix manufacturer for details on how to
use them in the Home Bakery.
** Q: Can I use a Home Bakery at higher altitudes?
A: All Zojirushi Home Bakery breadmakers are tested to function at an
altitude of up to 5,000 feet above sea level. The baking results are
affected because water evaporates faster at higher altitudes. If you are
at a higher elevation, always use a kitchen scale to measure your
ingredients and if the loaf rises too high and/or sinks, then please try
the following:
1. Decrease yeast by ¼ to ½ tsp.
2. Increase Water by 2 tbsp.
3. Decrease Sugar by ½ tsp.

More helpful tips can be found on our
*[[https://www.zojirushi.com/blog/?p=4617][“Common Bread Baking
Problems”]]* post.
** Q: Is there a backlight on the Home Bakery's screen?
A: The Home Bakery has easy-to-read LCD control panels but does not have
a backlight.
** Q: Is the nonstick coated baking pan in my Zojirushi Home Bakery breadmaker PFOA-free?
A: Yes, all of our breadmakers' nonstick coated baking pans are
PFOA-free.
** Q: Why did my /Home Bakery Maestro/® Breadmaker BB-SSC10 make a clunking noise while it was kneading?
A: While kneading the BB-SSC10 will make a clunking sound when the Auto
Add Dispenser mechanism activates to add ingredients. This sound is
normal and will be heard even when the Auto Add Dispenser is not
attached.
** Q: Can I remove the kneading blade(s) from the dough before the baking cycle starts?

A: It's not recommended. Manipulating the dough during any of the rising
cycles will result in shorter and denser loaves. For the best results
with the breadmaker, it's best to let it carry out the course as
programmed.
** Q: What is the purpose of a Preheat/Rest cycle?

A: Most preprogrammed courses in Zojirushi Home Bakery breadmakers will
start off with a Preheat/Rest cycle. It may seem that the breadmaker is
not doing anything during this cycle but it's working hard to stabilize
the temperature of the ingredients you have added into the pan. It makes
sure the ingredients are at the best temperature for baking, which is
especially important during the colder seasons.
** Q: Is the baking pan, kneading blades, and other accessories dishwasher safe?

A: The baking pan, kneading blades, and other accessories are not
dishwasher safe. To ensure their longevity, please hand wash them using
a mild dishwashing liquid and a soft sponge. For more detailed care
instructions, please refer to your breadmaker's instruction manual.
** Q: Can I use the breadmaker overseas using a voltage converter or plug adapter?

A: The electrical products you see on this website are manufactured to
be used in the US or Canada, and the use of voltage converters or plug
adapters are not recommended. Should the unit become damaged or require
service after being used overseas, any repair services, parts, and
warranty would only be available within the US and Canada.
** Q: Where can I order replacement parts for my Home Bakery?

A: Replacement parts may be ordered from our online
*[[https://shop.zojirushi.com/pages/parts-accessories][Zojirushi Parts &
Accessories page]]* or by calling our Customer Service Department at
800-733-6270, M-F, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. PST. Please have the model
number ready when calling.
** Q: Where is my nearest Service Center?

A: Please see a list of our
*[[http://www.zojirushi.com/app/service_centers][Authorized Service
Centers]]* to find your nearest Service Center. Please have the model
number ready when calling.
** Q: Can the Zojirushi Home Bakery Breadmaker make gluten-free bread?

A: Yes, the newer /Home Bakery Virtuoso/® Breadmakers (BB-PAC20 and
BB-PDC20) and /Home Bakery Maestro/® Breadmaker (BB-SSC10) comes with a
designated gluten-free course and recipes. The /Home Bakery Supreme/®
Breadmakers (BB-CEC20 and BBCC-X20) come with a gluten-free bread
recipe, and more can be found on our
*[[http://www.zojirushi.com/app/recipe/breadmakers][Recipes Page]]*.
Breadmaker recipes may be adapted to other models of our breadmakers.
The internet is also a good source for gluten-free recipes as well as
other bread recipe books. (Please use the Home Made course when baking
gluten-free breads: Preheat 15 minutes, Knead 25 minutes, turn OFF Rise
1 and Rise 2, Rise 3 55 minutes, and Bake 55 minutes. Keep Warm
optional.)
** Q: Can I use my own recipes?

A: The recipes in the instruction manual have been specially written for
the Home Bakery breadmaker. We recommend you use the recipes in the
instruction manual whenever possible. However, if you would like to try
other recipes, here are some important things to keep in mind:
Please be sure that the total amount of ingredients does not exceed the
capacity of the Home Bakery breadmaker. If so, the ingredients may
overflow and cause damage to the machine, which will not be covered
under warranty. A good rule of thumb is:

- 2 lb. loaf capacity (BB-PDC20, BB-PAC20, BB-CEC20, BBCC-X20, V20): No
  more than 5 cups (or 20 oz., 567 g) of flour with 2 cups (473 ml) of liquid

- 1 lb. loaf capacity (BB-SSC10, BB-HAC10): No more than 2-1/2 cups (or
  10 oz., 283.5 g) of flour with 1 cup (236.588 ml) of liquid

Please be sure to measure correctly using a digital scale and, if
possible, use recipes written for bread machines.

** Q: Can I use home-ground or home-milled flour?

A: After some testing, it was determined that it is possible to use this
type of flour. However, the flour must be measured by weight and not by
volume. This is because the texture of home-milled flour may differ from
those sold in stores. Some home-milled flour may be ground too fine or
too coarse. Please calculate the weight required in recipes in the Home
Bakery manual by following this formula for 1 cup:
| Flour             | Weight Per Cup |
|-------------------+----------------|
| White Bread Flour | 128 g          |
| Wheat Bread Flour | 120 g          |
| All-Purpose Flour | 130 g          |

Please also note that home-ground or home-milled flour may leave
scratches on the pan and kneading blades during kneading. This is
considered normal wear on the parts when using this type of flour.
** Q: Can I use all-purpose flour?

A: Bread flour is recommended because of its higher gluten content.
Gluten makes the bread dough more elastic which improves the rise and
texture of the finished product. All-purpose flour is best suited for
making pancakes, waffles, and cookies.\\
If all you have is all-purpose flour, you can add an egg as part of the
liquid, which will help the dough rise. You can also substitute 1
tablespoon of flour with dough enhancer, or make your own bread flour
using vital wheat gluten:\\
1. Measure out 1 cup of all-purpose flour (4-1/4 oz or 129 g)
2. Remove 1-1/2 teaspoons of the flour (1/8 oz or 4 g)
3. Add 1-1/2 teaspoons of vital wheat gluten (1/8 oz or 5 g)
4. Sift to combine
** Q: My loaf doesn't turn out right, what can I do?

A: We can help! Let's first make sure our ingredients are fresh, then
explore some common bread baking problems, and what steps can be taken
to correct them. Please visit
*[[https://www.zojirushi.com/blog/?p=4617][Our Blog Post]]* for details.

Service Department.]]*
** Q: What if my bread bakes unevenly?

A: Make sure that the kneading blade(s) is attached all the way to the
bottom before you start adding ingredients. This will ensure that the
ingredients will be kneaded thoroughly. Uneven loaves could also be the
result of dough that is too dry. Watch the dough through the viewing
window during kneading and if it seems dry, add water or milk one
teaspoon at a time, waiting to give the dough time to absorb the
moisture, until the right consistency is reached.
** Q: Why is the crust sometimes thick and/or hard?

A: A thick and/or dark crust usually means there is too much flour in
your recipe. This could be caused by flour that was not measured
accurately, or flour that is too old or too dry. To remedy this, reduce
the amount of flour by two tablespoons; or use milk instead of water. If
this still does not provide favorable results, please contact our
Customer Service Department for assistance by calling 800-733-6270, M-F,
8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. PST. Also see Q, [[#Q]["Can I use home ground
or home milled flour?"]] For other common baking problems, please visit
*[[https://www.zojirushi.com/blog/?p=4617][Our Blog Post]]*.
** Q: When should I weigh my flour when making bread in my Home Bakery breadmaker?

A: If you have a digital scale then you should always weigh your
ingredients. Please see below for guidelines:\\
- 1 cup of Bread Flour equals: 4.5 oz. or 128g
- 1 cup of Whole Wheat Bread Flour equals: 4.2 oz. or 120g
** Q: Why are the kneading blades loose?

A: This is perfectly normal and allows the blades to be removed easily
after every use. The kneading blades are designed to turn easily 1 to 2
inches in either direction around the shaft. If you turn the pan upside
down and the kneading blades fall out, this is also normal.
** Q: Why does my Home Bakery sometimes make a knocking noise?

A: Please ensure that the baking pan is securely locked in place. If the
pan is securely attached, then this may be the result of dough that is
too hard and dry. The knocking noise is the result of the hard dough
being "thrown" against the sides of the baking pan. Add water or milk
one teaspoon at a time, until the dough forms a ball. If the Home Bakery
breadmaker continues to make knocking noises, then please call our
[[https://zojirushiamerica5787.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new][*Customer
Service Department*]] for assistance at 800-733-6270, M-F, 8:00 a.m. to
5:00 p.m. PST.
** Q: What if I have a "Lid" signal displayed on my front panel even when the lid is closed?

A: Please open the lid and ensure the edge of the lid is free of debris,
then try closing it again while pressing down on the lid to ensure that
it is closed. If "Lid" is still displayed, make sure the baking pan is
seated properly. If "Lid" is still displayed, contact one of our
*[[http://www.zojirushi.com/app/service_centers][Authorized Service
Centers]]* in your area or our Service Department for assistance at
800-733-6270, M-F, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. PST.
** Q: What if my bread sticks in my bread pan?

A: The nonstick baking pan provides excellent release; however, the
kneading blades sometimes make the bread difficult to remove. Next time,
try to remove the bread within 10 to 15 minutes of baking. If necessary,
twist the wing nut that is under the pan in both directions to help
release the kneading blade from the loaf. Please use oven mitts while
handling the pan. Protect the nonstick interior of the pan from
scratches by not using sharp knives to cut or pry the bread out and do
not use anything abrasive to wash the pan. Also take a look at our

Tips]]* video for additional help.\\

** Q: Are the instructions or recipes for the Home Bakery available in other languages?

A: The instructions and recipes are only available in English. For
models BB-PDC20, BB-CEC20, and BB-SSC10 are also available in French.
** Q: What is the warranty on my Zojirushi breadmaker?

A: Please see our

** Bread Baking Problems and Solutions
[[https://www.zojirushi.com/blog/common-bread-baking-problems/][Link]]
** Collapsed or Sunken Loaf (Rising and Falling)

Cause: too much yeast, sugar or water, too little salt, or high
altitude.

/Here's what you can try doing to improve your loaf: /Reduce your yeast
by 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon to start with, and using cold water.  If you see
an improvement but it's still not /quite/ there, continue to reduce
incrementally.  Alternatively, you could try increasing salt, or
decreasing your sugar or water.

** Short, Dense, and/or Dark Loaf
Cause: typical of too much flour (or other dry ingredients) or not
enough liquid; less often a result of too little yeast, too little
sugar, too much salt, or old ingredients.

/Here's what you can try doing to improve your loaf: /Reduce your flour*
or increasing your liquids.  You can always check your dough during the
KNEAD cycle to make sure the texture isn't too dry.

** Lopsided Loaf
Cause: typical of too much flour (or other dry ingredients), not enough
liquid, or recipe size is too small

/Here's what you can try doing to improve your loaf: /Reducing your
flour* or increasing your liquids.  If you're using your own recipe, you
may need to increase the recipe size.  The minimum loaf size for our 2
pound bread machines is 1 1/2 pounds (BB-CEC20 and BB-PAC20), and 1
pound for our 1 pound machine (BB-HAC10).

** Lumpy Loaf
Cause: Typical of too much flour (or other dry ingredients) or not
enough liquid

/Here's what you can try doing to improve your loaf/: Reducing your
flour* or increasing your liquids.  Check the dough during the KNEAD
cycle---if it appears knotty or lumpy, you can add a tablespoon of water
at a time until a nice, round ball of dough forms.

** Unmixed Ingredients
Cause: The kneading blades were not installed properly, or kneading
blades have worn out.

/Here's what you can try doing to improve your loaf: / Installing
kneading blades before adding ingredients to the baking pan.  If you
suspect they have worn out, take the baking pan out of the bread machine
and place the kneading blades on the metal shafts.  Then, try turning
the blades with your finger.  Do they catch the shafts and make them
rotate?  If one or both doesn't, it's time to replace them.

** Add Ingredients Didn't Mix
Cause: Typical of too much flour (or other dry ingredients) or not
enough liquid.

/Here's what you can try doing to improve your loaf: / Reducing your
flour* or increasing your liquid.  When the dough is too dry, add
ingredients like nuts and raisins cannot penetrate the dough ball.

​*The weight of a cup of flour can fluctuate significantly depending upon
how the flour is measured.  Using the measuring cup as a scooper, or
pouring flour into the measuring cup will result in more of the
ingredient being used than our recipes call for.  You can reduce your
flour using one of two methods:

1. Volumetrically: Fluff your flour with a fork or a whisk to loosen it;
   then, spoon it into your nested measuring cups, and level off without
   tapping or shaking.
2. By weight: Weigh your flour with a digital kitchen scale (128g/4.51oz
   per cup for bread flour; 120g/4.23 oz for whole wheat flour, and
   125g/4.41oz for all purpose).  This method yields the most consistent
   and optimal results, and conveniently cuts out the guesswork.
